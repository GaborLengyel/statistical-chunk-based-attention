Instructions:

0. download the data files from the following osf project https://osf.io/paqhd/ and put all csv files in the /data folder (the data is already in the data folder so you can skip step 0)

1. Run *Experiment1_FrequentistStat.ipynb* with jupyter notebook (python 2 or 3) to see the frequentist statistical analysis and plots for experiment 1

2. Run *Experiment1_BayesianStat.ipynb* with jupyter notebook (R with BayesFactor 0.9.12-4.2. package) to see the Bayesian statistical analysis for experiment 1

1. Run *Experiment2_FrequentistStat.ipynb* with jupyter notebook (python 2 or 3) to see the frequentist statistical analysis and plots for experiment 2

2. Run *Experiment2_BayesianStat.ipynb* with jupyter notebook (R with BayesFactor package) to see the Bayesian statistical analysis for experiment 2



The scripts were tested with
- python 2.7.15
